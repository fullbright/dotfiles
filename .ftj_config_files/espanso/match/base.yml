              Description :

              On the Saturn Production environment we have high calculation time and latencies on manufacturing jobs.

              We then anayzed and found that an improvment is to increase the amount of thread in RxCP (from 1 to 3).

              We would like to measure the impact of this change on the database.

              We did a mass calculation on April 18th, 2018 from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM UTC.
              From 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM UTC : mass tests with number of thread = 1

              From 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM UTC : mass tests with number of thread = 3



              Hence, could you please retrieve all information about deadlocks, latencies, concurrent access or slowness (or needed information) ... on the database RxCP_DB34, for the instance awer0032\ikp1, for the 18th of April (before and after the increase of the number of thread) ?



              Thank you in advance for your help.

              Hello,


              I hope you are well.
              I have got an alert that new surfaces are back into GDP through Saturn KPDBs.

              Here is the list of DBs that contains surfaces:
              - 


              How to solve it?
              Use this spreadsheet as a tool (copy the spreadsheet and customize it) to remove the surfaces from your DB.


              I suggest exporting a backup of this database for future use.


              For the other Saturn DB backups you have, feel free to :
               - restore them using DBU, 
               - run the script on them to clean the surfaces and 
               - export a backup again without any surface.
